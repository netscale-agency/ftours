# About
- React application for travel agency F-tours. This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

# Requirements
- Node.js and npm [https://nodejs.org/en/]
- Visual Studio Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/], or similar code editor


# Getting started
- Clone Git repository and save it locally.
- Download dependencies defined in a package.json file and generate a node_modules folder with the installed modules:
    -Open new terminal and run command:
     npm install
     # or
     yarn install 

- Run the app in the development mode.
    npm start 
   
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
    (Note: Default port for running your Next.js application locally is port 3000. Since it is a commonly used, you might have other service running on the same port. It is recommended to check your terminal for the exact port number or change the `package.json` file.)
